## About the Application

This is a Rest API microservice which aims to calculate and return the **$A_n$** term of the **Alticci Sequence**.


### Alticci Sequence Definition

The Alticci Sequence ($A_n$) is defined following these math rules:

$$
A_n =
  \begin{cases}
    \nexists           & \quad \text{if } n < 0\\
    0                  & \quad \text{if } n = 0\\
    1                  & \quad \text{if } n = 1\\
    1                  & \quad \text{if } n = 2\\
    A_{n-3} + A_{n-2}  & \quad \text{if } n > 2
  \end{cases}
$$
